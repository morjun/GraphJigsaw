### Graph Jigsaw Learning for Cartoon Face Recognition, TIP 2022 

Cartoon face recognition is challenging as they typically have smooth color regions and emphasized edges, the key to recognizing cartoon faces is to precisely perceive their **sparse and critical shape patterns**. we propose the **GraphJigsaw** that constructs **jigsaw** puzzles at various stages in the classification network and solves the puzzles with the **graph convolutional network (GCN)** progressively.  **GraphJigsaw** significantly enhance the Cartoon face recognition accuracy with **no extra manual annotation during training** and **no extra computation burden during inference**.  We hope **GraphJigsaw** will shed light on understanding and improving the performance of cartoon face recognition.
